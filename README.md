👋 Hey there! I'm Nkwelle Ntungwe

🏆 About Me
I am a software engineer entering my third year at Lakehead University, specializing in computer science with a deep passion for cybersecurity, software development, and advanced computing technologies. Born in Africa, I grew up in a challenging environment where access to technology was scarce. However, my relentless curiosity and determination pushed me to self-learn computer science from the ground up. Through hard work, I mastered complex topics, from low-level programming to cybersecurity defense mechanisms, and developed a deep love for solving intricate technical problems.

Today, I focus on software security, reverse engineering, and advanced programming concepts, always seeking new ways to innovate and contribute to the tech community. I am currently looking for an internship where I can apply my expertise in cutting-edge technologies and tackle real-world challenges.

🔬 Projects & Research
I have worked on several highly advanced projects that go beyond standard software development, tackling real-world cybersecurity threats and engineering innovative solutions. Here are some notable ones:

🦠 Antivirus Engine
Developed a signature-based and heuristic-based malware detection system capable of identifying and neutralizing threats.
Implemented machine learning models to detect zero-day malware variants.
Built a custom sandbox environment to analyze malicious executables in an isolated setting.

🔏 Code Obfuscation & Reverse Engineering Defense
Engineered a code obfuscator to protect proprietary software against reverse engineering.
Utilized techniques like control flow flattening, dead code injection, and instruction reordering to make decompilation extremely difficult.
Studied and implemented various anti-debugging and anti-tampering mechanisms.

🎮 Anti-Cheat System for Online Games
Designed a real-time memory scanner to detect and block game cheats.
Implemented behavioral analysis techniques to flag suspicious player activity.
Used kernel-mode drivers to prevent unauthorized memory access and protect game integrity.

🕵️ Malware & Botnet Analysis
Researched botnet structures and analyzed real-world malware samples.
Created a network traffic analyzer to detect anomalies in data flow and identify potential botnet activity.
Simulated command-and-control (C2) infrastructure to understand how modern cyber threats operate.

🌍 Hacked Website Investigation & Security Hardening
Worked on penetration testing and ethical hacking to identify vulnerabilities in web applications.
Secured compromised websites by patching exploits, implementing WAF rules, and securing databases.
Developed custom intrusion detection systems to monitor and block cyberattacks.

📚 Skills & Technologies
I have experience with a broad range of technologies, including:

Programming Languages: C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Assembly (x86/x64)
Security & Reverse Engineering: IDA Pro, Ghidra, OllyDbg, Wireshark, Burp Suite, Metasploit
Web Development & Security: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, SQL, Web Application Firewalls
Low-Level & Systems Programming: Windows API, Linux Kernel, Memory Forensics
Cloud & DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, CI/CD Pipelines
Machine Learning for Security: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, anomaly detection in cybersecurity

🚀 Looking for an Internship!
I am currently seeking an internship opportunity where I can apply my knowledge in software development, cybersecurity, and system architecture. I am eager to work with like-minded professionals and contribute to innovative projects in cybersecurity, software engineering, or low-level programming.
